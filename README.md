# How to Install

You will need: Unity hub with Unity 2018.3.12f1 installed, a computer, a bit of computer knowledge

1. [Download the Unity hub application for your specific platform](https://unity.com/download) and go through its installation process. 
2. To use VoreWar, you will need specifically version 2018.3.12f1 intalled for your preferred platform (Windows, Mac, Linux). Navigate to that version on [this webpage ](https://unity.com/releases/editor/archive) and click "Install" to have it opened in the Unity hub.
3. From there you will need to select your platform in the installation packages if it was not selected for you. This allows you to build the game in the correct version for your computer OS.
4. After installing Unity successfully, navigate to the [github page](https://github.com/Flame-Valxsarion/VoreWar) and download the code via a zip file. Extract the zip file into the folder you wish to store and launch the game from. You should have a folder that looks like this.

5. Navigate to *\VoreWar-master\Assets and double click on the "base" file. It is a unity scene file, and will either automatically open in unity 2018.3.12f1 or you will need to choose an application (unity editor usually) to open it and use that.
6. It will now take awhile to load! So grab a snack. Join the discord [https://discord.gg/qTQSztP](https://discord.gg/qTQSztP). Or even just watch the progress bar go by and be patient. You do you.
7. Once it is done, you will be greeted with the unity editor screen. You can admire all the gadgets and gizmos but all you really need is to click is file>build and run. Then wait a bit for it to make the game.

8. With that, the game is now ready to play and should have opened up for you! You can close out of unity as well. To open it in the future, in the VoreWar-master folder, there is an application called "VoreWar" that you can use to load the game in the future. Feel free to make a shortcut to it from your desktop or wherever you store your games.
