<b><u><i>Note from Ignis</b></u></i> 
I know I'm missing a bunch of stuff 
as this game is seven years old now and I can 
only recall so much information on my own.
I'm especially unclear on who wrote what log messages
Or who wrote the events for that matter.
If you see anything missing that you would 
like added, please don't hesitate to contact 
me and let me know!
